[A.I. Is Prompting an Evolution, Not Extinction, for Coders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/ai-coding-software-engineers.html)  

By: Steve Lohr

Lohr’s article discusses how A.I. can change the way coders work in a way that is not necessarily negative. As a computer science student looking ahead to the industry, I found this interesting because it provides a positive way to think about the future. Additionally, the article confirms the feeling that I, along with many other computer science students, have, that we need to learn how to work with A.I. in order to be prepared to join the workforce. Another part of the article that I found interesting was the mention of how some job-training programs, such as Per Scholas, are helping lower-income workers enter the tech industry with an emphasis on working with A.I.  

Laura:  I agree with you that we, as developers, need to learn to work with A.I. rather than face it with fear. While I also find it interesting that the article mentions that working with A.I. is helping lower-income workers to enter the tech industry, the article also raises an important concern about entry-level roles. According to Lohr, junior developers may need to adapt more quickly by building strong fundamentals and learning how to effectively use A.I. tools.
