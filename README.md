[A.I. Is Prompting an Evolution, Not Extinction, for Coders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/ai-coding-software-engineers.html)  

By: Steve Lohr

Lohr's article talks about how A.I. can change the way the coders work, in a not necessarily negative way. As a Computer Science student looking ahead into the industry I found this intersting since it gives a positive way to think ahead. Aditionally, the article confirms the feeling I, and many other Computer Science students, have that we need to learn to work with A.I. in order to be prepared to join the workforce. Another piece of the article I fond intersting was the mention of how some job-training programs such as Per-Scholas are helping lower-income workers to join the tech industry with an emphasis on working with A.I.. 

### Comment- George Sanabria
I too found the article super interesting as it connects back to the real world. I agree with the notion that A.I. is our friend and not enemy however, there should be some boundaries in place. Although A.I simplfies certain functions I think it is vital to emphasize the importance of knowing how it work. If A.I systems were to go down it is key for developers to understand how to find another way which includes using their own knowledge. A blind reliance to A.I can cause detrimental effects and can widen the gap between a developer skills.
