[A.I. Is Prompting an Evolution, Not Extinction, for Coders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/ai-coding-software-engineers.html)  

By: Steve Lohr

Lohr’s article discusses how A.I. can change the way coders work in a way that is not necessarily negative. As a computer science student looking ahead to the industry, I found this interesting because it provides a positive way to think about the future. Additionally, the article confirms the feeling that I, along with many other computer science students, have, that we need to learn how to work with A.I. in order to be prepared to join the workforce. Another part of the article that I found interesting was the mention of how some job-training programs, such as Per Scholas, are helping lower-income workers enter the tech industry with an emphasis on working with A.I.

### Lily Barchana Lorand Comment:

I agree with you that the article is honest about the mismatch between perceived supply and demand of software engineering jobs. What I found particularly interesting in this article was the way that Corginia breaks down specific things that surprised him in interviews as well as specific moments in which he did not succeed in interviews. The groundedness and authenticity in his writing was also a major part in why I enjoyed reading the article. Generally, I think the way he frames the approach to job interviews is very educational.
